## EX 1.1 You have developed a software program that can be used in different computer environments. Which particular quality aspect does this software adhere to? What would happen if it did not have this quality?

Portability. The software is portable, meaning that it can run on different computer systems without much hassle. Java (because of JVM) is one of the most recognized languages for portability/cross-platform because software developed in Java can run wherever the JVM can run. (JVM reads bytecode that .java is compiled into)

## EX 1.2 What are the various quality aspects to be followed while designing and developing a software program?

Usability, reusability, portability, efficiency,

## EX 1.3 Provide examples and describe the implications of code reuse, and reuse the algorithms and data structures, in terms of development of a software system.

A good example of reuse is the Requests library for python. It can be reused in various ways for different projects.

sed is also a great use of an algorithm
