# How to read these notes

Theres nothing special about these notes, but the naming convention might be a bit off-putting. Each number symbolizes the chapter of the book, at least it tries to.

```
02.01.algorithmanalysis.md
```

02 symbolizes the second chapter, 01 symbolizes which part. This isnt followed very strictly, especially in instances where its pointless (or just inefficient) to split the contents into different parts

If you encounter a sentence with a list of words within brackets, such as: 

>John Doe is a gentleman and a {scholar, father, husband, billionaire}

It means any of the words are viable and true. You can pick and choose which word you want to use, but all are true.
