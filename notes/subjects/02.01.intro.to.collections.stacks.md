# Introduction to Collections - Stacks

## Objectives

* Define the concepts and terminology related to collections.

* Explore the basic structure of the Java Collections API.

* Discuss the abstract design of collections.

* Define a stack collection.

* Use a stack collection to solve a problem.

* Examine an array implementation of a stack.

# Collections

- Object that gathers and organizes other objects.

- Also designs specific ways objects within the collection (called elements) are accessed and managed. (Ruleset for the specific collection. LIFO/FIFO etc).

- User of the object (another class essentially) must only interact with the collection in the prescribed way.

## Broad categories

Organization of elements in a collection (relative to each other), is usually determined by one of two things

* The order in which they were added to the collection

* Some inherent relationship among the elements themselves (??)

### Linear

- Elements of the collection are organized in a straight line (vertical or horizontal, doesnt matter)

### Non-linear

- Elements of the collection are organized in something other than a straight line. Hierarchy or a network. FWIW, a nonlinear collection may not have any organization at all.

## Figure 3.1

A linear collection may always add new elements to one of the ends in the collection (either front or back), which determines the order of which they are added. Another linear collection may be organized in another fashion, for example in alphabetical order.

The specific organization of the elements in a nonlinear collection can also be determined by either of these two ways.

## Abstract Data Types

### What is an abstraction

An abstraction hides certain details at certain times. Using abstraction, we hide _di_stractions like having to deal with knowing what every part of the car does, or knowing everything an abstract {java, python, golang} class does.

You dont need to know every method of the Comparable class to use it to compare strings alphabetically. 

Car example from the book:

> For example, we couldn't possibly drive a car if we had to worry about all the details that make the car work: the spark plugs, the pistons, the transmission, and so on. Instead, we can focus on the _interface_ to the car: the steering wheel, the pedals, and a few other controls. These controls are an abstraction, hiding the underlying details and enabling us to control an otherwise very complicated machine.

A collection (as well as any well designed object) is an abstraction,
