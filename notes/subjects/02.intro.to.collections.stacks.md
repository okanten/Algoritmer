* Define a stack collection.

* Use a stack collection to solve a problem.

* Examine an array implementation of a stack.

## Collections

- Object that gathers and organizes other objects.

- Also designs specific ways objects within the collection (called elements) are accessed and managed. (Ruleset for the specific collection. LIFO/FIFO etc).

- User of the object (another class essentially) must only interact with the collection in the prescribed way.

### Broad categories

#### Linear

- Elements of the collection are organized in a straight line (vertical or horizontal, doesnt matter)

### Non-linear

- Elements of the collection are organized in something other than a straight line. Hierarchy or a network. FWIW, a nonlinear collection may not have any organization at all.
