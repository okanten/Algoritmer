# Self-Review Questions

## SR 1.1 Define Software Engineering.

Software engineering is a way of creating software with a certain level of quality, in the same vein as other types of engineering: Such as structual engineering, electrical engineering etc. 

## SR 1.2 What are the basic goals of software engineering?

The basic goals of software engineering is to make sure the software is created in a professional manner, built to last, withstand errors and be less prone to failure. The goal is to treat software development (as in, the developers treat it that way) with the same level of respect as other engineering fields, with the fears that come with failure. 

If a bridge collapses, lifes can be lost, but the same can apply to software engineering, if the software is running on medical equipment or some sort of equipment for emergency services (among other things)

## SR 1.3 What is the difference between the terms Correctness and Robustness in relation with software designing?

Correctness is when a system is designed correctly in relation to the clients demands. In other words, the software is correctly designed (with quality characteristics) to comply with the specific requirements (kravspec)

When something is robust it is designed to be less prone to failure, by, for example, being coded in such a way that exceptions are handled correctly. It means it will be able to handle errors.

## SR 1.4 What do you understand by usability and reusability of software?

Usability is what defines how usable the software is to the client/user. Reusability is whether or not you can use the same code base in a different project. 

Lets say you develop a piece of software (a library perhaps), it is in your (and others') best interest to make it reusable. Reusable software is defined by how extendable it is, fragmented\*, easily managed etc.


\* as in, its not engrained into the source code of another piece of software.

## SR 1.5 How do you ensure that a software system is maintainable?

To make sure a software system is maintainable a good idea is to have great documentation, as well as being designed in a well structured and well written way. 

Its also important to keep the documentation updated!

## SR 1.6 What do you understand about data structures?

Data structures is a way of structuring data in the same vein as you would structure shipping containers on a boat and on land. Its a way of making sure the data you have is easily accessible, or atleast thats the benefit of a good data structure. Its a method used to make a collection of data structured.

## SR 1.7 What do you understand by the efficiency of software?

Efficient software is designed in a way that uses less resources and clever design. A good data structure is one way of making sure data handling is done in a fast and clever way.

Equally important, is the user interface. The user must be able to be efficient in the software, and it has to be designed in with the users skills in mind. A web interface for email in an office setting should be designed to be accessible/usable by anyone, but an editor (such as Vim) can be designed with a learning curve for the users benefit.
